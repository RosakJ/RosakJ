Hi, Iâ€™m @RosakJ, or John!

I really like working with, and learning more about code, but more specifically, my interests include:

  - Data Analysis/Visualization/Representation
  - Web Design and hosting
  - UI and UX design

Outside of my work, I enjoy

  - Running and physical training
  - Organization systems (Fiend in Notion)
  - Clean and beautiful home workspaces (My Instagram feed is all desks...)

Recently I graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics. I'm currently looking for a job in a related field to gain experience and do more of what I love every day.

To learn more about me, check out my LinkedIn or better yet, my Website hosted right here on GitHub!
